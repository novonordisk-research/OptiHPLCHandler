# Examples Outline

Here is an outline of all the current examples.

## Example: [Basic Usage](example_basicusage.ipynb)

Here outlines the basic usage of EmpowerHandler in OptiHPLCHandler. This includes:

- Installation & updating
- Importing and login
- Connection token (For easy EmpowerAPI access)
- Get attributes of EmpowerHandler
  - GetMethodList()
  - GetSetup()
  - GetNodeNames()
  - GetSystemNames()
  - GetPlateTypeNames()
- Sample set method creation
- Sample set method posting to Empower
- Sample set method running on chosen system

## Example: [Varying Injection Volume (Linearity)](example_linearity.ipynb)

Here outlines a basic linearity experiment where one sample (and therefore one vial location) is injected at varying injection volumes.

- Varies injection volume within a range in a defined increment.
- Samples in sample set defined in for loop, varying the injection volume.

## Example: [Varying Sample Positions (examples_multivial.ipynb)](example_multivial.ipynb)

Here outlines a basic sample set method where the sample position is incremented depending on the defined plate.

- Plate sample position logic defined (for ANSI-48Vial2mLHolder).
- Samples in sample set defined in for loop, varying the sample position.

## Example: [Get, inspect, change, and put back a instrument method](example_instument_method.ipynb)

Here outlines how to interact with instrument methods and instrument methods.

- Finding and getting a instrument method.
- Inspecting what types of instrument methods are in the instrument method.
- Inspecting the instrument parameters in the method, including column temperature and gradient table.
- Changing instrument parameters and posting the new method.

## Example: [Method generation from an input instrument method](example_method_generators.ipynb)

Here outlines a series of method generators that takes an input instrument method and generates a variety of methods from them.

- Generates a ramp-up method of the input method, taking the first row of the gradient table as the basis and ramping the flow rate slowly over a period of time to elongate column life-time and prevent huge pressure spikes.
- Generates a condensed version of the input methods gradient to condition the column prior to use.
- Generates a version of the method where the temperature is changed by a certain value eg. +/- 5 Â°C
- Generates a method that has the same gradient slope as the initial method, but with a different value of the strong eluent. eg. +/- 1 %B
- Generates a method with an isocratic step in a defined place in the gradient table. eg. a 10 minute isocratic start

## Example: [Using method generation, makes a basic robustness sample set for an defined input method](example_robustness.ipynb)

Here outlines the use of the above method generators, making a sample set method to test the robustness of the method.
